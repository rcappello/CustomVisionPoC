# Custom Vision PoC

Custom Vision PoC is a simple project to demonstrate how to use Microsoft [Custom Vision](https://www.customvision.ai) API to train a model and use it to test the trained model.



---

PoC built with .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI).

[.NET MAUI](https://dot.net/maui) is a cross-platform framework for creating mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared codebase.

## .NET MAUI Official Samples

Official samples can be accessed via the [Samples browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?expanded=dotnet&products=dotnet-maui).

Getting started

To use an online model (the offline model will be available in the future), launch the app, go to the Settings page and then set Service Name, Iteration Name, Prediction Key and Project Id using the values you can grab from Custom Vision Service Portal.
